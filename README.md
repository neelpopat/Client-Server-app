# Client-Server-app
Python Project

This project describes how the client and server communicate using TCP sockets, both client and server is secured with the password and username. The username and password which is sent by the client and server to save the data from external disruptions. We used exception handling that is used to remove the errors from the file. Also, Authentication gets off, if the user login more than 3 times then automatically, the connection between the server and the client is being stopped. The client starts an application with the menu options; there are 1 to 6 options where a user can select any option and starts sending information to the server. Once the server receives information and confirms that the information is relevant or not and sends back to the client. 

First Option, display the domain name and IP address that is being belonged to the client. In Option 2, we calculated the mean, maximum and minimum from the text file which we created earlier. TCP protocol is the reliable protocol because it always gives the relevant information whether the connection is there or not and also receives bad information from the client and server. 

The main purpose of this project is to make a work easier for the higher companies so that, it will be easier for them to collect the huge amount of data, domain names and ip addresses with respect to the time. In the project, there are 6 menu options from where there is distribution of tasks which has to be performed by the users. There is also removing and addition of organization from the file. With the storing and updating of data to the list, it will be great assistance for the multinational companies.  

This application is for localhost(Both client and server run on the same machine).
